Hashtag is a simple social networking platform that allows you to connect to different people around different organizations and locations. Hashtag has an aim of disculding bad words, bad posts, and any form of abusive behavior that violates our Policies.

Hashtag was built as an alternative to the traditional social networking platform that allows you to connect to different people around different organizations and locations. But with hashtag we can gurantee that your privacy and your feelings towards social networking is our responsibility. We are trying to make this platform very safe and easy to use.
